# ECS (Entity Component System) Architecture Design

## 1. Core Goals

- Implement a lightweight, easy-to-use ECS system
- Keep code clean and maintainable
- Integrate well with existing systems (events, resources, scenes)
- Provide basic support for 2D game development

## 2. Basic Implementation

### 2.1 Entity
- Simple ID identifier
- Optional name
- Active state

### 2.2 Component
- Basic components:
  - Transform (position, rotation, scale)
  - Sprite (sprite rendering)
  - Collision (collision box)
- Pure data structures, no logic

### 2.3 System
- Basic systems:
  - RenderSystem (rendering)
  - CollisionSystem (collision detection)
- Process entities with specific component combinations

### 2.4 World
- Entity management
- Component management
- System updates

## 3. Integration with Existing Systems

### 3.1 Event System
- Entity creation/destruction events
- Component change events

### 3.2 Resource System
- Component resource references
- Resource lifecycle management

### 3.3 Scene System
- Scene entity management
- Scene transition handling

## 4. Development Plan

### 4.1 Phase One (Current)
- [x] Basic Entity implementation
- [x] Basic Component implementation
- [x] Basic System implementation
- [x] Basic World implementation

### 4.2 Phase Two
- [ ] Transform component
- [ ] Sprite component
- [ ] RenderSystem
- [ ] Basic collision detection

### 4.3 Phase Three
- [ ] Event system integration
- [ ] Resource system integration
- [ ] Scene system integration

## 5. Considerations

### 5.1 Keep It Simple
- Avoid over-engineering
- Prioritize core functionality
- Add features as needed

### 5.2 Code Organization
- Clear directory structure
- Good documentation
- Simple interface design

### 5.3 Performance Considerations
- Basic memory optimization
- Avoid unnecessary virtual functions
- Choose appropriate data structures

## 6. Future Possibilities

### 6.1 Optional Extensions
- Simple animation system
- Basic physics system
- Debug tools

### 6.2 Optimization Directions
- Component data layout optimization
- System execution efficiency
- Memory usage optimization
