- **�� Enemy System**: **COMPLETED** - Basic enemy AI and spawning system
  - ✅ EnemyComponent and related components
  - ✅ EnemySpawnSystem (spawn control, positioning, component configuration)
  - ✅ ZombieAISystem architecture (inherits from engine::ECS::AISystem)
  - ✅ Collision-based attack system
  - ✅ Performance optimizations (spawn limits, cleanup logic)
- **🚀 Projectile System**: **NEWLY COMPLETED** - Complete bullet system implementation
  - ✅ ProjectileComponent with comprehensive properties
  - ✅ ProjectileSystem for movement, lifetime, and cleanup
  - ✅ Event-driven projectile creation (`CREATE_PROJECTILE` events)
  - ✅ Boundary checks and performance optimization
  - ✅ Penetration system support
- **🎯 Damage System**: **NEWLY COMPLETED** - Complete collision-based damage system
  - ✅ DamageSystem for bullet vs enemy collisions
  - ✅ Enemy vs player collision handling
  - ✅ Damage calculation and event publishing
  - ✅ Integration with engine's collision detection

### ❌ **Critical Missing Components**
- **Testing Integration** - 🔥 **NOW HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **Rendering integration and visual feedback** - 🔥 **SECOND PRIORITY**
- **Actual gameplay loop** - 🔥 **THIRD PRIORITY**

## 🚀 Next Development Plan (Prioritized)

### **1. Testing Integration** - 🔥 **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Goal**: Integrate new systems into ZombieTestScene for comprehensive testing

**Missing from ZombieTestScene**:
- ProjectileSystem not added to scene
- DamageSystem not added to scene
- No Phase 9 test for shooting mechanics
- No bullet vs enemy collision testing

**Implementation steps**:
1. Add ProjectileSystem and DamageSystem to ZombieTestScene
2. Create Phase 9: TestProjectileSystem() method
3. Test complete shooting flow: Input → Fire → CreateProjectile → Movement → Collision → Damage
4. Verify bullet cleanup and performance

### **2. Rendering Integration and Visual Feedback** - 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal**: Transform "console output game" into "visual game"

**To implement**:
- Integrate existing entities with engine's RenderSystem
- Add sprite components to players, enemies, bullets
- Basic UI display (health, ammo, experience)
- Simple visual effects (muzzle flash, impact effects)

**Implementation steps**:
1. Add Sprite2D components to all entities
2. Configure engine's RenderSystem to display game entities
3. Add basic UI overlay (health bars, ammo counters)
4. Implement simple particle effects for bullets and impacts

### **3. Gameplay Loop Enhancement** - 🔥 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Goal**: Complete the game experience with proper game states and progression

**To implement**:
- Wave system (increasing difficulty)
- Game state management (start, playing, game over)
- Victory/defeat conditions
- Progressive enemy spawning

**Implementation steps**:
1. Create WaveSystem for managing enemy waves
2. Implement GameStateManager
3. Add victory/defeat conditions
4. Balance difficulty progression

## 🎮 Current System Status

### **✅ Working Systems**
- **Player Movement**: Full 360-degree movement with WASD
- **Weapon Systems**: Firing, reloading, ammo management
- **Enemy AI**: Basic zombie tracking and collision attacks
- **Enemy Spawning**: Controlled spawn rates with proper cleanup
- **Health System**: Damage dealing and health management
- **Experience System**: XP gain and leveling up
- **Event System**: All systems communicate through events
- **🎉 Projectile System**: Complete bullet creation, movement, and cleanup
- **🎉 Damage System**: Complete collision-based damage handling

### **🔄 Partially Working**
- **Combat System**: All components work, but not integrated in test scene
- **Visual Feedback**: All logic works but no visual representation

### **❌ Missing**
- **Testing Integration**: New systems not tested in ZombieTestScene
- **Visual Rendering**: Game runs in console only
- **Game Loop**: No win/lose conditions or progression

## 🚨 Technical Debt and Considerations

### **Performance Status**
- ✅ **EnemySpawnSystem**: All performance issues resolved
- ✅ **ProjectileSystem**: Built-in performance optimization with max projectile limits
- ✅ **DamageSystem**: Event-driven, efficient collision handling

### **Code Organization**
- ✅ Event system architecture is solid and extensively used
- ✅ ECS architecture is clean and extensible
- ⚠️ ZombieTestScene missing integration of new systems

### **Extensibility**
- ✅ Current architecture supports future weapon types, enemy types, upgrade systems
- ✅ Projectile system supports multiple projectile types and penetration
- ✅ Damage system supports multiple damage types and sources

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After completing the next 3 priorities, you'll have a complete playable game:
- ✅ Player can move and aim (DONE)
- ✅ Enemies track and attack the player (DONE)
- ✅ Player can shoot and kill enemies (DONE - Implementation complete, testing needed)
- ⏳ Visual feedback and UI (NEXT: Rendering Integration)
- ⏳ Proper game loop with progression (NEXT: Gameplay Loop)

**Current Progress: ~85% Complete** 🎉
