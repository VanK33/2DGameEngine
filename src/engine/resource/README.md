# ResourceManager Design - 2D Game Engine

## Overview

The `ResourceManager` module provides centralized resource loading, caching, and lifecycle management for game assets, particularly textures. It is designed to handle **efficient resource reuse**, **automatic memory management**, and **reference counting** to prevent resource leaks while maintaining optimal performance.

The decision to build a dedicated `ResourceManager` stems from these needs:

* Centralize asset loading and prevent duplicate resource allocation
* Provide automatic reference counting for safe resource sharing
* Abstract platform-specific resource loading details
* Enable efficient resource caching and batch operations
* Support fallback mechanisms for missing assets

**Status: COMPLETED âœ… - Production Ready**

## Key Design Choices

### 1. **Reference Counting System**

The ResourceManager implements automatic reference counting for all loaded textures:

* `LoadTexture()` increments reference count (or loads if new)
* `ReleaseTexture()` decrements reference count
* Resources are automatically freed when reference count reaches zero
* Prevents memory leaks and duplicate loading

### 2. **Path Normalization**

All asset paths are normalized to ensure consistent caching:

* Handles relative and absolute paths uniformly
* Prevents cache misses due to path variations
* Supports cross-platform path handling

### 3. **Fallback Texture Support**

The system supports fallback textures for missing assets:

* `SetFallbackTexture()` defines a default texture
* Failed loads return fallback instead of null
* Prevents crashes from missing assets during development

### 4. **Thread-Safe Operations**

Resource operations are designed to be safe for concurrent access:

* Proper mutex protection for cache operations
* Safe for use across multiple systems
* Supports multithreaded resource loading

### 5. **Comprehensive Logging**

Detailed logging for debugging and optimization:

* Resource loading/unloading events
* Reference count tracking
* Cache status reporting
* Performance timing information

## Example Usage

```cpp
// Initialize ResourceManager
ResourceManager resourceManager(renderer);

// Load textures (automatically cached)
SDL_Texture* playerTexture = resourceManager.LoadTexture("sprites/player.png");
SDL_Texture* enemyTexture = resourceManager.LoadTexture("sprites/enemy.png");

// Resources are automatically reference counted
SDL_Texture* sameTexture = resourceManager.LoadTexture("sprites/player.png"); // Reuses cached version

// Release when done (automatic cleanup when ref count reaches 0)
resourceManager.ReleaseTexture("sprites/player.png");
resourceManager.ReleaseTexture("sprites/player.png"); // Texture freed here

// Set fallback for missing assets
resourceManager.SetFallbackTexture(defaultTexture);

// Debug cache status
resourceManager.PrintCacheStatus();
```

## Integration with Engine Systems

### **Renderer Integration**
- Requires SDL_Renderer for texture creation
- Seamlessly works with SpriteRenderer
- Supports all SDL3 texture formats

### **ECS Integration**
- Used by Sprite2D components for texture management
- Automatic cleanup when entities are destroyed
- Efficient sharing of textures across entities

### **Scene Integration**
- Scene-specific resource loading and cleanup
- Automatic resource management during scene transitions
- Support for preloading scene assets

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficient**: Reference counting prevents duplication
- **Fast Access**: O(1) cache lookup for loaded resources
- **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight caching mechanism
- **Scalable**: Handles hundreds of textures efficiently
