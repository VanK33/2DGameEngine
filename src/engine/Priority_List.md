# Engine Priority List: 2D Top-Down Zombie Shooting Game

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the **10 most critical tasks** needed to make the engine ready for building a 2D top-down zombie shooting game. The engine will be used as an external library, so focus is on creating a clean, standalone API that can be easily integrated into game projects.

**Target Game:** 2D top-down zombie shooting game with player movement, weapon systems, enemy AI, collision detection, and basic UI.

**Important:** Engine provides **generic systems**, game provides **game-specific components**.

---

## ðŸš¨ Risk Mitigation

### **If Behind Schedule:**
1. **Skip Task 10** - Game state management can be implemented in the game
2. **Simplify Task 9** - Use basic SDL audio instead of complex audio system
3. **Focus on core systems** - Prioritize Tasks 1-5 over polish features
4. **Use existing systems** - Leverage current scene and event systems

### **If Performance Issues Arise:**
1. **Profile first** - Don't optimize prematurely
2. **Reduce entity count** - Design games with fewer objects
3. **Simplify collision** - Use basic AABB instead of complex shapes
4. **Optimize rendering** - Batch similar sprites

---

## ðŸ’¡ Development Tips

### **Start Simple:**
- Build a basic prototype with just player movement and generic physics
- Add AI entities one feature at a time
- Test each system independently before integration

### **Focus on API Design:**
- Design for external use from the beginning
- Keep interfaces simple and consistent
- Provide good documentation and examples

### **Test Early:**
- Create test scenes for each system
- Validate that external games can use the engine
- Fix API issues before adding features

### **Remember Engine vs Game Separation:**
- **Engine provides:** Generic systems (ECS, collision, physics, AI framework, events)
- **Game provides:** Game-specific components (health, weapons, zombies, power-ups)
- **Engine handles:** How things work (movement, collision, rendering, events)
- **Game handles:** What things are (health systems, weapons, enemies, items)

*This priority list focuses on building a complete, usable engine with generic systems that any 2D game can use. Game-specific components like health, weapons, zombies, and power-ups should be implemented in the game, not the engine.*
