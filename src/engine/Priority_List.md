# Engine Priority List: 2D Top-Down Zombie Shooting Game

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the **critical tasks** needed to make the engine ready for building a 2D top-down zombie shooting game. The engine will be used as an external library, so focus is on creating a clean, standalone API that can be easily integrated into game projects.

**Target Game:** 2D top-down zombie shooting game with player movement, weapon systems, enemy AI, collision detection, and basic UI.

**Important:** Engine provides **generic systems**, game provides **game-specific components**.

**Current Status: Core Engine API COMPLETED âœ… - Ready for AI Framework Development**

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Immediate Actions

### **Priority 1: AI Framework Development**

**Required Files to Create:**
```
src/engine/core/ecs/components/AIComponent.hpp
src/engine/core/ecs/systems/AISystem.hpp
src/engine/core/ecs/systems/AISystem.cpp
```

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **AIComponent**: Store AI state and behavior data
2. **AISystem**: Process AI behaviors and decision making
3. **Basic Behaviors**: Follow, wander, patrol patterns
4. **AI Events**: Communication between AI entities
5. **Integration Testing**: Validate with existing systems

### **Priority 2: Game Example Creation**

Create a complete 2D top-down shooter example to validate all systems:
- Player movement and input
- Enemy AI behaviors
- Shooting mechanics
- Collision detection
- Resource management

## ðŸš¨ Risk Mitigation

### **If Behind Schedule:**
1. **Skip Task 10** - Game state management can be implemented in the game
2. **Simplify Task 9** - Use basic SDL audio instead of complex audio system
3. **Focus on AI Framework** - This is critical for game functionality
4. **Use existing systems** - Leverage current scene and event systems

### **If Performance Issues Arise:**
1. **Profile first** - Don't optimize prematurely
2. **Reduce entity count** - Design games with fewer objects
3. **Simplify collision** - Use basic AABB instead of complex shapes
4. **Optimize rendering** - Batch similar sprites

## ðŸ’¡ Development Tips

### **Current Focus:**
- **AI Framework is the next critical milestone**
- Engine API is proven and ready for use
- All core systems are integrated and working
- Focus on game-specific functionality now

### **API Design Success:**
- Engine initialization works in 3 lines of code
- Clear separation between engine and game achieved
- Consistent naming conventions throughout
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **Remember Engine vs Game Separation:**
- **Engine provides:** Generic systems (ECS, collision, physics, AI framework, events)
- **Game provides:** Game-specific components (health, weapons, zombies, power-ups)
- **Engine handles:** How things work (movement, collision, rendering, events, AI behaviors)
- **Game handles:** What things are (health systems, weapons, enemies, items)
