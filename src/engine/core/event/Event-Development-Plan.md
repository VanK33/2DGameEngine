# Event System Development Plan for 2D Game Engine - IN PROGRESS ✅

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the **essential** features needed for the Event System in our 2D game engine, **prioritized for a single-person project with tight deadlines**. The goal is to build multiple games for homework assignments quickly, not to create a production-ready event system.

**Status: Phase 1 & 2 COMPLETED ✅, Phase 3 IN PROGRESS**

**Features Implemented:**
```cpp
enum class EventPriority {
    CRITICAL = 0,    // System events, must be processed first
    HIGH = 1,        // Game logic events
    NORMAL = 2,      // Default priority
    LOW = 3          // UI updates, visual effects
};

class Event {
    EventPriority getPriority() const { return priority_; }
    void setPriority(EventPriority priority) { priority_ = priority; }
};

class EventManager {
    void publishWithPriority(std::shared_ptr<Event> event, EventPriority priority);
    void processEventsByPriority();  // Priority-based processing
};
```

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Priority-based event processing with thread safety

---

## 🎨 Phase 2: Essential Event Integration - COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ **2.1 Enhanced EventManager Integration - COMPLETED**
**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `EventManager.hpp/cpp` (refactored with responsibility separation)

**Features Implemented:**
```cpp
class EventManager {
    // Core functionality
    void subscribe(EventType type, EventListener* listener);
    void publish(std::shared_ptr<Event> event);
    void update();  // Now uses priority-based processing
    
    // Priority support
    void publishWithPriority(std::shared_ptr<Event> event, EventPriority priority);
    
    // Responsibility separation
    void processEventsByPriority();
    void processEvent(const std::shared_ptr<Event>& event);
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Event>> getAndSortEvents();
};
```

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Refactored with clean responsibility separation

## ⚡ Phase 3: Event Filtering - IN PROGRESS 🔄

### 🔄 **3.1 Basic Event Filtering - IN PROGRESS**
**Files to Create:**
- 🔄 `EventFilter.hpp`
- 🔄 `ConditionalEventListener.hpp`

**Features to Implement:**
```cpp
class EventFilter {
public:
    virtual ~EventFilter() = default;
    virtual bool ShouldProcess(const Event& event) const = 0;
};

class TypeFilter : public EventFilter {
    std::vector<EventType> allowedTypes_;
public:
    bool ShouldProcess(const Event& event) const override {
        return std::find(allowedTypes_.begin(), allowedTypes_.end(), 
                        event.getType()) != allowedTypes_.end();
    }
};

class ConditionalEventListener : public EventListener {
    std::unique_ptr<EventFilter> filter_;
public:
    void onEvent(const std::shared_ptr<Event>& event) override {
        if (!filter_ || filter_->ShouldProcess(*event)) {
            ProcessEvent(event);
        }
    }
