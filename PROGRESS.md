# Weapon Implementation Progress

## Status Before Implementing Aiming System

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **Movement System Fixed**: Player can now move with WASD keys
   - Added PhysicsSystem to Engine (was already there)
   - Added PhysicsModeComponent to player entity
   - Fixed constructor parameter mismatches

2. **Weapon Following System**: 
   - Created `FollowComponent.hpp` - defines follow behavior with target entity and offset
   - Created `WeaponFollowSystem.hpp/.cpp` - handles weapon positioning relative to player
   - Added `CreateWeapon()` method to `GameEntityFactory`
   - Modified `GameScene` to store player/weapon IDs and create weapon entity
   - Weapon entity has Transform2D, Sprite2D, FollowComponent, and AimingComponent

3. **System Integration**:
   - Added WeaponFollowSystem to GameScene with priority 35
   - Weapon follows player with 30px offset to the right
   - Weapon has visual representation (20x8 pixel sprite)

### üîÑ Currently Working On:
**Weapon Rotation Based on Mouse Direction**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue:
AimingSystem requires entities to have BOTH AimingComponent AND InputComponent, but:
- Weapon has AimingComponent but no InputComponent
- Player has InputComponent with mouse data
- Need to either:
  1. Add InputComponent to weapon (and copy mouse data from player)
  2. Modify AimingSystem to work without InputComponent
  3. Create a separate weapon rotation system

### üéØ Next Steps:
1. Add InputComponent to weapon entity
2. Modify WeaponFollowSystem to copy mouse data from player to weapon
3. Add AimingSystem to GameScene system registration
4. Test weapon rotation with mouse movement

### üìÅ Files Modified:
- `/src/examples/zombie_survivor/ecs/components/FollowComponent.hpp` (NEW)
- `/src/examples/zombie_survivor/ecs/systems/WeaponFollowSystem.hpp/.cpp` (NEW)
- `/src/examples/zombie_survivor/ecs/GameEntityFactory.hpp/.cpp` (modified)
- `/src/examples/zombie_survivor/GameScene.hpp/.cpp` (modified)
- `/src/engine/input/InputManager.cpp` (debug logs removed)
- `/src/examples/zombie_survivor/ecs/systems/InputSystem.cpp` (debug logs removed)

### üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture:
```
Player Entity:
- Transform2D (position, rotation)
- Sprite2D (visual)
- InputComponent (mouse/keyboard input)
- MovementComponent, Velocity2D, etc.

Weapon Entity:
- Transform2D (position, rotation)
- Sprite2D (visual)
- FollowComponent (follows player with offset)
- AimingComponent (for rotation toward mouse)
- [NEEDS] InputComponent (for AimingSystem compatibility)
```

### üîó System Flow:
1. InputSystem: Updates player's InputComponent with mouse position
2. WeaponFollowSystem: Updates weapon position + copies mouse data to weapon
3. AimingSystem: Calculates aim direction for weapon
4. RotationSystem: Applies rotation to weapon based on aim direction
