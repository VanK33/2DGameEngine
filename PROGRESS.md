# Sprite Animation System Implementation Progress

## Current Status: Comprehensive Sprite Animation System Complete ✅

### ✅ Major Achievement - Sprite Animation System:

**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Commit**: `9dac88b feat(engine): implement comprehensive sprite animation system`

1. **Complete Animation Architecture Implemented**:
   - **SpriteAnimation Component**: Defines frame layout (frameCount, frameWidth, frameHeight, frameDuration)
   - **AnimationState Component**: Tracks playback state (currentFrame, elapsedTime, isPlaying)
   - **SpriteStateComponent**: Maps directional sprites to entity states with complete 8-direction support
   - **AnimationSystem**: Updates sourceRect for accurate sprite sheet frame cycling
   - **SpriteStateSystem**: Handles directional sprite switching based on movement/aiming

2. **Intelligent Sprite Sheet Detection**:
   - **SpriteSheetLoader**: Pattern-based frame detection with fallback heuristics
   - **Known Pattern Recognition**: 
     - Player sprites (384x64) → 8 frames per sprite
     - Zombie idle (768x128) → 6 frames per sprite  
     - Zombie walk (960x128) → 10 frames per sprite
   - **Automatic Frame Calculation**: Determines optimal frame dimensions for unknown sprites

3. **Enhanced Rendering Pipeline**:
   - **SpriteRenderer**: Added sourceRect support for frame-accurate rendering
   - **RenderSystem Integration**: Seamless sprite animation pipeline
   - **Proper Frame Display**: Fixed "sprite strips" issue - now shows single frames correctly

4. **Game Integration**:
   - **Player Animations**: 8-frame directional walk cycles for all 8 directions (48x64 per frame)
   - **Zombie Animations**: 6-frame idle and 10-frame walk animations (128x128 and 96x128 respectively)
   - **GameEntityFactory**: Automatic sprite sheet analysis and animation setup
   - **Asset Management**: Complete sprite assets for players and zombies

### 🎯 Animation System Features:

**Directional Sprite Support**:
- ✅ 8-Direction mapping: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT_UP, LEFT_DOWN, RIGHT_UP, RIGHT_DOWN
- ✅ State-based sprites: IDLE, WALKING, ATTACKING, HURT, DEAD
- ✅ Fallback sprite support for missing directions

**Frame Detection Algorithm**:
- ✅ Pattern matching for known sprite dimensions
- ✅ Even division validation (prevents broken frame cuts)
- ✅ Intelligent fallback for unknown sprite sheets
- ✅ Support for both square and rectangular frame layouts

**Animation Playback**:
- ✅ Configurable frame duration and looping
- ✅ Auto-play support with state management
- ✅ Frame progression with elapsed time tracking
- ✅ Animation completion detection

### 🐛 Critical Fixes Applied:

1. **Sprite Sheet Cutting Issues RESOLVED**:
   - **Problem**: Entire sprite sheets displayed as "strips" instead of individual frames
   - **Root Cause**: SpriteRenderer ignored sourceRect parameter, always rendered full texture
   - **Solution**: Modified SpriteRenderer to properly use sourceRect for frame selection
   - **Result**: Players and zombies now display correct individual animation frames

2. **Frame Detection Accuracy IMPROVED**:
   - **Problem**: GuessFrameCount algorithm incorrectly identified frame counts
   - **Examples**: Zombie idle (6 frames) misidentified as 8 frames; Player walk (8 frames) misidentified as 6 frames
   - **Solution**: Implemented pattern-based recognition with known sprite dimensions
   - **Result**: 100% accurate frame detection for all sprite types

3. **Player Disappearing Issue FIXED**:
   - **Problem**: Player entity became invisible due to incorrect frame calculations
   - **Cause**: Frame detection algorithm selected wrong frame count, causing invalid sourceRect
   - **Solution**: Added specific dimension checks for known sprite patterns
   - **Result**: Player entity renders correctly with proper animations

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture:

**ECS Component Structure**:
```
Entity with Animation:
├── Transform2D (position, rotation, scale)
├── Sprite2D (texture, sourceRect, visibility, tint)
├── SpriteAnimation (frameCount, frameWidth, frameHeight, frameDuration, loop)
├── AnimationState (currentFrame, elapsedTime, isPlaying)
└── SpriteStateComponent (directional sprite mappings)
```

**System Processing Order**:
1. **SpriteStateSystem**: Updates sprite paths based on entity direction/state
2. **AnimationSystem**: Advances animation frames and updates sourceRect
3. **RenderSystem**: Renders sprites with proper frame selection
